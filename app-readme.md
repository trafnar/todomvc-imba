## Implementation

This app was created with Imba, a compile-to-js language with syntax similar to ruby/python/coffeescript. Imba includes a component based framework as part of the language.

The implementation centers around a TodoMVC component, or "tag" as its called in Imba. The tag definition is similar to a class definition. This tag includes all the logic of the app including routing. Individual Todos were extracted into their own Todo tag, simply to demonstrate nested tags.

Imba's unique architecture allows very straightforward state management, you can treat it as if the entire UI is re-rendered on every event, so you simply update variables as needed without any special state handling/updating concepts.
